# Udemy3DPlatformer
A platformer made with Unity Engine, based of a Udemy course.

This project is using assets and code from [James Doyles'](https://twitter.com/gamesplusjames) course [Unity 3D Platformer](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity3dplatformer/).
I'm mostly using the same logic, but am also trying to improve on the code shown in the videos by refactoring, keeping hard coded values to a minimum, sometimes setting up the possibility to render things optional (like the knockback on damage), extracting methods instead of putting all the logic in the Update() method, and keeping the scripts tidy with regions.

I'd also like to implement unit tests to the scripts, and using Unity built in option for testing, in general.
